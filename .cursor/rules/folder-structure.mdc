Use a consistent, modular folder structure:


/frontend
  /components
  /pages
  /hooks
  /utils
  /styles
/backend
  /src
    /controllers
    /routes
    /models
    /services
    /utils
/shared (for types or interfaces used by both FE & BE)

Avoid deep nesting beyond 2â€“3 levels

Keep logic separated: no business logic in components
